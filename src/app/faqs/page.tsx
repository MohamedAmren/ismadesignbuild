    question: "What services do you provide?",
    answer: "We specialize in interior design, renovation, construction, and design & build solutions. Our services include space planning, 2D & 3D drawings, custom furniture, renovation works, flooring, curtains, and assistance with local authority submissions."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you provide both residential and commercial projects?",
    answer: "Yes. We work on residential homes, offices, retail spaces, and commercial properties."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I get started with a project?",
    answer: "Simply contact us with your project details. We'll arrange a consultation to understand your needs, prepare design concepts, and provide a quotation."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you charge for consultation?",
    answer: "Our initial consultation is usually complimentary. However, detailed design proposals, 3D renderings, and drawings may require a design fee (deductible if you proceed with the project)."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does a renovation or design project take?",
    answer: "Timelines vary based on project size and complexity. A small renovation may take a few weeks, while larger design & build projects can take several months."
  },

    question: "Can I request changes after work has started?",
    answer: "Yes, but changes may affect the timeline and cost. We'll discuss and get your approval before making adjustments."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you help with material selection?",
    answer: "Yes. We guide clients in choosing high-quality finishes, trusted brands (like Nippon Paint, Blum, Caesarstone, and TOTO), and materials that suit both style and budget."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you provide warranty for your work?",
    answer: "Yes. Workmanship warranty is included in most projects. Specific warranties for materials or appliances depend on the manufacturer."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you handle authority approvals?",
    answer: "Yes, we assist with local authority submissions and approvals as part of our full-service package."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the payment schedule like?",
    answer: "Typically, we require a deposit to begin. The remaining balance is collected in stages based on project milestones (e.g., design approval, progress completion, handover)."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you work within my budget?",
    answer: "Yes. We'll propose design solutions and materials that align with your budget while maintaining quality and durability."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you only do full projects or small works too?",
    answer: "We handle both. From small renovations and furniture builds to full design & build projects â€” no project is too small or too big."
